# Sign Language To Text Conversion

This repository is our submission to the minor project of our B.Tech 7th semester.

Trained Deeplearning Model - [ASL-Recognition]

Communication is a very important skill. It helps to exchange thoughts, share experiences and learn new things. Looking at today's 
fast moving world networking and communication becomes very essential.

Specially abled people who can not speak and hear get this barrier of not able to portray their thoughts to the world and hence getting one step behind 
the competition. The problem with them is not about communicating with each other but to some person who doesn't understands sign language.

This is where we hope to come in and become an intermediate, a translator to help the world understand these people.
